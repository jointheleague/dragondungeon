# Dragon Dungeon

## About

Dragon Dungeon is a free-to-play game from the LEAGUE of Amazing Programmers. This branch (template) contains the latest code of Dragon Dungeon 1.0.0 (November 2021) onwards. The legacy branch contains Dragon Dungeon code from versions 0.0.1 - 1.0.0 (December 2020 - October 2021). The master branch contains an outdated version that will be updated soon. The legacy branch is intended as a historical record - not a functioning game. It is no longer supported and has known bugs.
